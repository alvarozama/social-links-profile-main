## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

While I don't necessarily think I learned something new, this challenge was good practice on hover and focus states, as well as flexbox and sizing.

### Continued development

I'd like to focus more on a mobile-first workflow to ensure correct responsivenes of my designs given that I tend to start by building sites for wider screens and then struggle to make them responsively resize to adapt to smaller displays.
